# drowsiness-detection
Driver fatigue is a significant factor in many road accidents. Thus, driver drowsiness detection can help prevent a huge number of sleep induced road accidents. We used computer vision algorithms to extract facial features such as eye closure and yawning, followed by machine learning techniques to effectively detect driver state. We compared multiple machine learning models and used the most effective one to develop a real-time drowsiness detector. This system will warn the driver if it detects a drowsy state, hence preventing any harm that may have been caused to the driver and the passengers otherwise.

The models used are:
* K Nearest Neighbours 
*	Logistic Regression
*	Decision Tree Classifier
*	Na√Øve Bayes Classifier
*	Random Forest Classifier
*	Convolutional Neural Network
*	LSTM
We will be performing cross-validation along with hyperparameter tuning to maximize accuracy and precision.
